## Getting Started

This project is made using Flutter and dart.

Our goal for this app is to bridge the gap between a donor and organisations. When registering, the user has the option to choose if
he is a donor or an organisation.

Donor:
1. Enters basic information
2. Enters login information
3. The user is taken to the Donor screen
4. There will be many organisations listed on the screen.
5. User can choose an organisation.
6. The informations about the organisation is shown on screen and the user can scroll down to donate specific items.
7. The user then choose a date , a time slot to come donate the items.
8. The user can also input the ingredients if he is donating meals and the number of calories it contains.
9. The user confirm his donation and is routed to the Donor Screen.
